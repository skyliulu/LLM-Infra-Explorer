# LLM-Infra-Explorer

[English](./README.md) | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

> **Understand how large language models really work — from tokens to systems.**

An **interactive playground** for exploring **LLM systems, inference workflows, and AI infrastructure** through visualization and hands-on interaction.

🌐 Live Demo: https://skyliulu.github.io/LLM-Infra-Explorer/

## ✨ Why this project?

Modern LLM systems are **complex, opaque, and hard to reason about**:

- What actually happens during inference?
- How does KV cache evolve over time?
- What do DP / TP / PP really change in execution?
- Why are optimizations like Flash Attention so effective?

This project helps you **see and interact with these processes**, instead of just reading about them.

## 🧠 What you can explore

- 🖥️ **LLM Inference Panorama** — follow tensors from token embedding through Attention, Dense FFN or MoE experts, per-layer KV Cache, LM Head, and Temperature / Top-K / Top-P sampling
- 🔀 **Parallel Strategy Explorer** — compose DP / TP / PP / CP / EP / ETP, inspect matrix slicing and GPU rank mapping, and compare DP Attention, Wide-EP, P/D disaggregation, and runtime communication designs
- ⚡ **Flash Attention** — compare Standard Softmax with FlashAttention V1–V4 through forward/backward tiled pipelines, active SRAM tiles, HBM intermediates, and IO traffic
- 🔎 **Sparse Attention** — compare full Attention with DSA, CSA and HCA through cache, traffic and capacity budgets; drill from one architecture canvas into matrices and individual records, then play a query through projection, selection, reads, softmax and output with pause, step and speed controls.
- 🚀 **Flash Decode** — contrast Unsplit and Split-K decode, Contiguous and Paged KV layouts, MHA/GQA/MQA head sharing, CTA scheduling, workspace writes, and final reduction
- ✨ **Speculative Decoding** — compare serial Target decoding with block verification, then explore EAGLE-2 dynamic draft trees and DSpark confidence-scheduled semi-autoregressive blocks
- 📦 **Quantization & Low-Precision Inference** — start from BF16 weights to inspect INT4, INT8, FP8 and FP4 representation, storage and error; distinguish weight, activation and KV precision, then explore offline algorithms and SGLang v0.4.6.post5 checkpoint loading, activation quantization and paged KV access.
- 🧬 **Engram (DeepSeek)** — trace tokenizer compression, multi-head n-gram retrieval, context-aware gating, short convolution, and inference/training data movement
- 🌲 **Radix Cache** — explore radix-tree prefix reuse, per-request reference locks, capacity deficits, LRU leaf eviction, and paired K/V page allocation
- 📈 **Linear Attention** — move from Standard Softmax to kernelized linear Attention, recurrent state updates, and Gated Linear Attention (GLA)
- 🔁 **DP Attention** — compare standard TP Attention with MLA-oriented DP Attention, including KV ownership and TP-FFN or EP-MoE communication paths

## Using the interactive workbench

1. Start with the problem, then compare resource benefits and costs under shared assumptions.
2. Switch between actual algorithm alternatives; inspect cooperating components together in their system overview.
3. Click a component or matrix record to inspect its inputs, outputs, provenance and mechanism.
4. Use play, pause and step for ordered processes. Sparse Attention defaults to two seconds per step and offers adjustable speed.

Resource values use each module's stated teaching model or sources. Cache capacity, read bytes and measured latency are different quantities; animation pacing is not GPU execution time. Modules support Chinese and English.

## 🧭 Roadmap

The next chapters will continue to connect algorithm-level tensor flows with runtime scheduling, memory ownership, and physical communication. The list below describes candidate directions rather than a fixed delivery order.

### Inference algorithms

- **Speculative Decoding Extensions** — benchmark-backed hardware profiles, EAGLE-3, native MTP, multi-round serving traces, and engine-specific batching/runtime boundaries
- **Quantization extensions** — Real checkpoint calibration and task evaluation, hardware measurements of specific kernels, additional low-precision formats, and quantized graph transformations

### Serving runtime and memory

- **Continuous Batching & Scheduler** — request lifecycle, chunked prefill, decode batching, preemption, admission control, and latency/throughput trade-offs
- **KV Memory Hierarchy** — GPU/CPU/NVMe offload, tiered KV Cache, migration, prefix reuse, and disaggregated KV ownership

### Distributed systems

- **MoE Serving & Load Balancing** — expert placement, token dispatch, capacity pressure, Expert Parallelism, All-to-All, and dynamic expert rebalancing
- **Interconnect & Collective Communication** — NVLink, PCIe, InfiniBand/RDMA, NCCL collectives, hierarchical All-Reduce, Reduce-Scatter, and All-to-All
- **Inference Performance Model** — TTFT/TPOT decomposition, compute-vs-memory bottlenecks, Roofline intuition, utilization, and end-to-end profiling evidence

Suggestions and implementation references for these chapters are welcome through GitHub Issues.
