# Develop an Interactive Module

Build an explicit teaching model before building the interface. Choose interactions that fit the learning object; do not add animation, comparison, or architectural layers by default.

## 1. Capture the existing contract

Read `AGENTS.md`, neighboring modules, routing, shared components, and the current QA record. For an existing module, render every current mode and record:

- the teaching question and accepted interaction structure;
- the controls, canvases, inspectors, and cross-view interactions that must remain;
- the behavior that may change in this iteration;
- representative baseline states and responsive widths.

Classify the work as a repair, extension, or structural redesign. Default to the smallest change that satisfies the request. Do not replace the information architecture during a repair or extension unless the user authorizes that scope.

For a repair or extension, treat the existing layout as an acceptance constraint, not as optional inspiration. Unless the user explicitly authorizes a structural redesign or large-scale refactor:

- preserve the order, relative prominence, and spatial relationships of major regions;
- preserve control placement, primary canvases, inspectors, and established interaction paths;
- add or correct evidence inside the existing regions before introducing new panels or moving content;
- do not replace a page-wide composition, split ratio, navigation pattern, or responsive reading order merely to make implementation cleaner;
- stop and explain the required structural tradeoff before editing if the requested behavior cannot fit the existing contract.

Capture a rendered baseline before the first layout-affecting edit. After implementation, compare the same states and widths against that baseline; a technically correct result still fails the change contract if it unnecessarily destroys the accepted layout or interaction structure.

Declare the change surface before editing: list the dimensions that can alter behavior (for example mode, lifecycle state, language, or viewport), the affected views, and the behavior that must remain unchanged. Include only dimensions relevant to this iteration.

Before adding an entry or panel, classify the new content as an alternative mechanism, a cooperating subsystem, a numeric format, or an implementation example. This determines its place in the existing chapter and control hierarchy; a new technical term alone does not justify a new section. Apply the integration guidance in [content-and-math.md](references/content-and-math.md) and the architecture drill-down guidance in [interaction-model.md](references/interaction-model.md).

For top-level controls, first inventory neighboring modules and capture the repository's control contract: order, grouping, shape, label semantics, trailing-edge placement, and responsive breakpoint. Reuse the established pattern for semantically equivalent controls instead of introducing a chapter-specific variant. Treat language as a presentation preference; use the repository's established single-toggle or segmented pattern consistently, and make a toggle label communicate the target language. In timeline modules, keep the reset/play/next group at the trailing edge when that is the repository convention. Deviate only when the chapter has a real interaction need, and record the reason in QA.

## 2. Declare the teaching capabilities

State which capabilities the module actually needs:

- `timeline`: ordered execution with play, pause, step, or scrub;
- `multiple-modes`: modes whose mechanisms or consequences differ;
- `resource-metrics`: quantitative capacity, traffic, latency, or utilization;
- `structural-comparison`: representations or architectures compared on shared dimensions;
- `data-movement`: ownership, transfer, routing, or communication paths;
- `dense-layout`: matrices, cards, lanes, or other high-density responsive content;
- `math`: mathematical notation that must use the shared renderer.

These capabilities select interaction and QA requirements; they are not a required feature list. A structural explorer does not need a global playback state, and a timeline should not be added merely to satisfy a convention.

## 3. Verify claims and boundaries

Use primary papers, official documentation, or real implementations when technical behavior is uncertain. Record a compact claim ledger with the claim, authoritative basis, assumptions, capability boundary, model consequence, and visible evidence.

Verify formulas, shapes, data dependencies, ownership, resource scaling, and execution context before implementing the UI. Distinguish training, prefill, and decode when relevant. Label deliberate simplifications and version-specific behavior; never let a simplification reverse the real conclusion.

## 4. Build one canonical domain model

Read [interaction-model.md](references/interaction-model.md). Classify each control as independent input, derived value, constrained input, mutually exclusive mode, or presentation-only preference. Normalize inputs before deriving a pure snapshot.

Store only user-controlled and lifecycle state. Derive every canvas, metric, formula, highlight, and explanation from the same model. Keep technical rules out of ad hoc JSX branches. Add module-level model regression when the legal state space is large or interactions have important invariants.

For `timeline`, model the real dependency order and keep exactly one operation active. For other capabilities, use the interaction grammar that best exposes structure, ownership, comparison, or parameter sensitivity.

## 5. Design claim-to-evidence interactions

Read [visual-grammar.md](references/visual-grammar.md). For each important claim, specify:

1. the user action or state that exposes it;
2. the visual variable or relationship that changes;
3. the expected early, representative, boundary, or final snapshot.

A mode switch must visibly change every layer it claims to affect. Reuse the primary visual objects when adding movement, ownership, or annotations instead of creating a second disconnected explanation. Allocate space by information density and preserve the existing visual hierarchy unless the change contract permits otherwise.

## 6. Implement the smallest coherent slice

Read [content-and-math.md](references/content-and-math.md). Implement or correct the pure model first, then connect the existing views to it, then refine visual encoding and prose. Route display prose through i18n and mathematical notation through the shared KaTeX renderer.

Keep rendering a pure model-to-UI mapping. Separate domain derivation, translated content, visual primitives, and panels when complexity justifies it. Avoid broad refactors that do not contribute to the accepted teaching claim or regression safety.

Reuse an existing shared control component when the repository provides one. Otherwise copy the smallest established markup and interaction semantics from a neighboring module, including dimensions, icon sizing, target-language text, dynamic accessible names, disabled states, and responsive wrapping. Do not standardize controls by moving or rebuilding unrelated content.

## 7. Validate in layers

Read [qa-checklist.md](references/qa-checklist.md). Run the common convention checks plus the declared capabilities:

```bash
node .agents/skills/develop-interactive-module/scripts/check-module-conventions.mjs src/components/YourModule.jsx --capabilities timeline,math,multiple-modes
npm run build
```

Use three complementary verification layers:

- pure-model tests for formulas, constraints, invariants, and large combination spaces;
- browser interaction tests for key controls, coupled state, and representative paths;
- rendered QA for visual evidence, responsive density, both languages, accessibility, and console output.

When the change surface contains several values or coupled dimensions, create a small module-owned QA matrix and validate it with:

```bash
node .agents/skills/develop-interactive-module/scripts/check-qa-matrix.mjs path/to/qa-matrix.json
```

The matrix declares arbitrary dimensions and required cross-products; keep domain-specific values and assertions in the module, not in this skill.

Turn every confirmed defect into a reusable regression assertion, browser case, or checklist item. Update `design-qa.md` with the current result, evidence, unresolved limitations, and change-contract impact. Do not declare completion from source inspection or a successful build alone.

### Chapter identity and control prominence

- Use `src/lib/chapter-icons.js` as the single chapter-icon mapping. Body titles render `ChapterIcon` with their chapter ID; navigation and home cards use the same mapping through the chapter registry. Do not choose a separate decorative icon in a chapter header. Preserve unique, content-relevant icons across chapters and check title/navigation agreement when adding or changing a chapter.
- Keep primary experiment policies discoverable. For Radix HiCache, prefetch, backup and runtime-condition controls are expanded by default. Minimum-load tuning and the companion-reader toggle are deliberately omitted from the teaching UI; do not restore them just because the engine model supports them. Retain the shared-prefix visualization itself.
- Distinguish optional runtime diagnostics from controls needed to explore the main teaching question. Reduce secondary controls before hiding primary policies. A preference for one chapter is not a requirement to expand every disclosure in every chapter.
