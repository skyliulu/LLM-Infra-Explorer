# Interaction Model

## Match interaction to the learning object

Choose the smallest interaction grammar that exposes the concept:

| Learning object | Suitable interaction |
|---|---|
| Ordered execution | play, pause, step, scrub, active/passed/pending stages |
| Structure or ownership | select, inspect, lock, highlight relationships |
| State lifecycle | allocate, grow, reuse, evict, commit, reset |
| Algorithm comparison | switch modes on shared inputs and scales |
| Parameter sensitivity | adjust a parameter and derive all consequences immediately |
| Resource or data movement | show locations, direction, transfer, and ownership changes |

Do not invent a timeline for a structural explorer or reduce a real dependency chain to disconnected configuration cards.

## Architecture drill-down

For cooperating subsystems, show their organization and input/output connections together before explaining each one. Use selection within the architecture, not comparison tabs that imply the subsystems are alternatives. Real alternatives may still use mode switches.

In a microscope-style explorer, keep overview, selection and detailed principle in one workbench. A click should reveal the selected component's inputs, operation and outputs without requiring a jump to an unrelated section below. Retain the parent context and a return path. A component with one drill-down action should expose its whole visible surface as a keyboard-accessible target, not only a small caption; avoid nesting controls inside that target.

When the overview becomes a miniature beside detail, render the same topology with the same node order, connections and selection. Scale that scene instead of inventing a different compact arrangement. If values become too small, offer a larger/original-size view. Page columns may stack responsively without changing the internal scene's meaning.

Controls that alter an architecture-wide input belong beside its overview. Name input presets by an understandable behavior or feature, not just A/B or an unexplained technical adjective. Keep a stable record identity when tracing it between caches, indices and outputs.

## Use one canonical domain model

Store only user-controlled input and genuine lifecycle state. Names may vary by module, but the dependency direction must remain explicit:

```js
const normalizedInput = normalizeInput(userInput);
const snapshot = deriveModuleState(normalizedInput, lifecycleState);
```

The snapshot should contain every fact needed by the views: structure, dimensions, ownership, resource values, current operation, status, and capability boundaries. Compute matrices, counters, memory use, code highlights, and explanatory copy from this snapshot rather than storing duplicate state.

For objects shown in several views, assign stable semantic identities in the model. Derive location, residency, selection, activity, and visibility from that identity so a user can follow the same object across canvases instead of interpreting unrelated lookalikes.

## Classify controls and dependencies

For each control, record whether it is:

- an independent input;
- a derived value that should not be edited directly;
- a constrained input with a documented normalization rule;
- mutually exclusive with another mode;
- a presentation preference that must not change the technical model.

Changing an input must either preserve compatible progress or deterministically reset/remap it. Never silently couple independent controls, and never present a derived constraint as a universal technical law.

## Keep modes structurally truthful

Give each mode its real state shape, dependency order, ownership, and resource consequences. Align stages or dimensions only when they are genuinely comparable. A mode switch that claims a mechanism change must update every affected canvas, metric, formula, code highlight, and explanation.

Distinguish logical intermediates from persistent state. Distinguish a replicated value from a partitioned value, and an unavailable or non-resident component from a component that does not exist.

## Add timeline state only when needed

For a `timeline` capability, include `phase`, `step`, `isPlaying`, and the relevant token, chunk, layer, or event position. Model the real loop:

- finish the current operation before advancing its enclosing token or chunk;
- represent prefill, decode, training, tiling, and parallel work according to their real execution;
- keep exactly one operation active and distinguish `active`, `passed`, `pending`, and `done`;
- stop cleanly at `done` and keep reset, play/pause, step, and scrub consistent;
- pause playback when the user manually inspects a stage.

## Validate large state spaces outside the UI

When controls create many legal combinations, expose pure derivation functions and test invariants without rendering every case. Use browser tests for representative control paths, coupled transitions, and visual evidence rather than as the only correctness mechanism.

Declare only the state dimensions affected by the current change. Test each declared value and every cross-product where dimensions can influence one another; do not multiply unrelated dimensions merely to produce an exhaustive-looking matrix.

## Interaction acceptance questions

1. What learning object does the interaction expose?
2. Which input changed, how was it normalized, and which views derive from it?
3. Is every claimed mode difference visible in the affected layers?
4. Does a timeline follow the real dependency order, if a timeline exists?
5. Can the user explain what a control changed without searching elsewhere?
