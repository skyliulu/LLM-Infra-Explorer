## Architecture

**LLM-Infra-Explorer** is a React SPA for interactively visualizing LLM infrastructure concepts. It deploys as a static site to GitHub Pages.

**Stack:** React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion + Lucide React

### Navigation flow

`main.jsx` → `App.jsx` → `MainDashboard.jsx` (sidebar + tab routing) → individual visualization components

`MainDashboard` manages which tab is active via local `useState`. Clicking a card on `HomeLanding` navigates to the corresponding visualization. The sidebar is collapsible on mobile.

### Visualization modules (`src/components/`)

Each file is a self-contained, interactive visualization:

| Component | Concept |
|---|---|
| `LLMInference.jsx` | Token prefill/decode, KV cache lifecycle, MoE vs Dense, temperature sampling |
| `ParallelStrategies.jsx` | 6D parallel topology (DP/TP/PP/CP/EP/ETP), tensor slicing, GPU mapping |
| `FlashAttention.jsx` | Tiled attention vs standard, SRAM/HBM IO tracking |
| `SparseAttention.jsx` | Single-canvas full-attention cost comparison, DSA selection, CSA/HCA compression with SWA, source provenance and separate indexer accounting |
| `CacheArchitecture.jsx` | CSA2 40-layer cache ownership, separate Top-K sources, FP4 byte budgets, CED prefill/decode and bounded decoder replay |
| `FlashDecode.jsx` | KV cache splitting, parallel reduction |
| `SpeculativeDecoding.jsx` | Autoregressive baseline, Draft–Target verification, rejection correction, KV rollback, tree candidates |
| `Quantization.jsx` | Offline RTN/AWQ/GPTQ/SmoothQuant, INT4/INT8/FP8 representation, online activation/KV quantization and scale lifecycle |
| `Engram.jsx` | DeepSeek n-gram memory retrieval, async prefetch |
| `RadixCache.jsx` | SGLang radix tree KV cache, LRU eviction, block reuse |
| `DpAttention.jsx` | DP/TP hybrid attention, KV cache sharding, cross-rank communication |
| `LinearAttention.jsx` | Softmax, kernelized linear attention, recurrent state, and GLA gating |

### Styling conventions

- Dark theme throughout: `bg-slate-950`, `text-slate-100`
- Framer Motion for animated transitions (`motion.div`, `AnimatePresence`)
- `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` for conditional class composition
- Responsive breakpoints: `md:` for sidebar/layout changes

### Shared workbench conventions

- Use `src/lib/chapter-registry.js` for routes, chapter descriptions, search aliases, and related chapters. Sidebar labels remain English; translated content uses the shared language provider.
- Use `chapter-page`, `chapter-layout`, `chapter-header`, and `chapter-body` with `src/components/workbench.css` for outer spacing and surfaces. Keep algorithm geometry, density, semantic colors, and split ratios module-owned. Group reset/play/step so the group wraps together.
- Use `useExperimentState` only for genuine experiment configuration. Configuration survives chapter navigation, including visits to Home; lifecycle/playing state stays local and unmounts on departure. Reload persistence is explicit through a share link, not implicit autosave.
- Shareable primary settings need validators in `experiment-sharing.js`; never serialize timers, DOM geometry, derived snapshots, or arbitrary component state. Add a stable `data-section-anchor` to major headings for bilingual section links. Run `npm run check:workbench` when changing sharing or routing.

### Visualization component conventions

Every visualization component (`src/components/*.jsx`) follows the durable project conventions below. Page structure and stage count remain concept-dependent; do not force a module into a layout that misrepresents the underlying algorithm.

**Theme:** Components use light mode internally (`bg-slate-50 text-slate-800`, cards as `bg-white border border-slate-200`), contrasting with the dark shell. This "entering a workbench" feel is intentional.

**Top control bar structure (default):** Keep title + subtitle, primary comparison mode, reset/play/step controls, and language switching together when they affect the whole module. Place controls that affect only one lower canvas beside that canvas instead of in the global header.

**i18n pattern:** All text goes through `t(key)`. Every component has a top-level `i18n = { zh: {...}, en: {...} }` object where `zh` and `en` keys are identical. Language comes from shared `useLanguage()` in `src/lib/LanguageContext.jsx`. The site header owns the only language control; saved preference takes precedence over browser language, and sidebar labels remain English. Do not add chapter-local language state or buttons. Never hardcode display strings in JSX.

**Mathematical notation:** All mathematical expressions must be authored as LaTeX and rendered through the shared KaTeX-backed math component (`MathFormula`). Do not imitate formulas with plain strings, Unicode subscripts/superscripts, or `font-mono`. Keep language-dependent prose in i18n, but keep language-independent LaTeX source outside the translation dictionaries. Complex equations must be paired with a variable explanation or a visualization that makes their role clear.

**Timeline capability:** Use a playback state machine only when ordered execution is part of the learning object:
```js
const [phase, setPhase] = useState('idle');   // 'idle' | 'running' | 'done'
const [step, setStep] = useState(0);
const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
// Timeline modules require handleNextStep(), reset(), togglePlay().
```

**Timeline auto-play pattern:**
```js
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isPlaying || isDone) return;
  const timer = setTimeout(handleNextStep, delay); // delay varies per step
  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [isPlaying, step, ...deps]);
```

**Canonical domain model:** Store only user-controlled and genuine lifecycle state. Normalize constrained inputs, then use a pure `getXxxState(...)`, `deriveXxxModel(...)`, or equivalent function to compute all render data. Rendering is always a pure `model → UI` mapping with no side effects.

**Interaction capabilities:** Declare only the capabilities a module needs: timeline, multiple modes, resource metrics, structural comparison, data movement, dense layout, and math. Timeline state such as token/chunk position and active stage is conditional; mode, execution context, dimensions, parameters, selection, and lifecycle state must still drive every dependent canvas, metric, formula, code highlight, and explanation from one model.

**Layout:** Choose the smallest layout that makes the teaching relationship clear. A canvas, pseudocode panel, and principle inspector may be arranged in columns, rows, or layered sections. Do not require a fixed three-panel layout. When execution order is the learning object, show the full pipeline in one canvas and distinguish `active`, `passed`, and `pending` stages.

**Color semantics:**
- Give algorithms persistent identity colors only when comparison benefits from them
- Separate algorithm identity from transient active/write/warning/done colors
- Alert/bottleneck: `rose` with `ring` glow (`shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(244,63,94,0.5)]`)
- Optimal/done: `emerald` / `green`
- Inactive: `bg-slate-100 border-slate-200`
- Pseudocode bg: `bg-[#0d1117]`
- Verify contrast for selected buttons, pale backgrounds, formulas, matrix cells, lines, and sliders; never rely on hue alone

**Visualization principles:**
- Start from one teaching question and make the design-level difference visible before implementation details
- Distinguish alternative algorithms from coexisting subsystems. For a system with cooperating branches, start with its architecture and input/output connections, then let users drill into layers, components, and individual records while retaining a breadcrumb and return path. Use comparison switches for real alternatives, not for parts that coexist in one system.
- Use Before/After only when a real baseline/solution comparison exists
- Show logical and physical layers only when both materially explain the concept
- Give different algorithms their real stage maps; never align fake stages for UI symmetry
- Advance a token only after its actual pipeline completes; represent prefill/chunk/parallel work truthfully
- Encode growth, fixed capacity, compression, recurrence, gating, movement, or parallelism through changing visual variables instead of prose
- Keep matrices/tensors compact, readable, and dimension-labeled; do not stretch tiny values into oversized boxes
- Metrics (IO traffic, hit rate, memory blocks) are computed dynamically from the canonical model, never stored as duplicate state
- When engine pseudocode contributes to the teaching claim, it must expose runtime operations such as allocation, metadata, cache/state access, kernel dispatch, and write-back rather than translating formulas line by line

**To create, modify, extend, substantially refactor, or QA an interactive module**, use `$develop-interactive-module` from `.agents/skills/develop-interactive-module/SKILL.md`. Follow its interaction, visual grammar, content/math, and rendered QA references. Record final evidence in `design-qa.md`.

### Deployment

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) builds and deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`. The Vite base path is relative (`./`) so the build works at any deployment path.
